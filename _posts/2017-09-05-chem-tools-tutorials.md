I have created a [GitHub repository (and page)](https://kbsezginel.github.io/chem-tools-tutorials/)
to host tutorials, tips and scripts for several computational chemistry tools that I use.
These include scientific software for running chemistry calculations as well as tools for data and molecular visualization.

I am hoping other people in WilmerLab (and maybe other labs) will join me in this effort
to put together this open source tutorial page that will ease transition of new graduate
students and help people from other instutions.
