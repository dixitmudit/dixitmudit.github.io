**Have you ever tried opening a molecule file that you received from a colleague, or a file that you found online
and ended up spending half an hour trying to make it work?** Even though chemical files mostly have
well-defined formats, implemenation differences between the software that reads and writes these files
can cause problems. This problem is especially significant in file formats where a cell is defined
in addition to atomic coordinates (e.g. crystals).

An **easy** and **cross-platform** way to visualize molecules is using **web-applications**.
This allows you to make sure that the file you shared with your colleague would be visualized the exact same way.
Or even better, **you can embed the molecule in your web-page** and just send a link!
Here's how you can do all that.

3DMol.js
========

[3Dmol.js](http://3dmol.csb.pitt.edu/index.html){:target="_blank"} is an object-oriented, webGL based JavaScript library for online molecular visualization. It supports several formats (*pdb, sdf, mol2, xyz,* and *cube*), can show regular geometric shapes and surfaces using customizable styles.

Embedding from a file
---------------------
The biggest advantage of [3DMol.js](http://3dmol.csb.pitt.edu/index.html){:target="_blank"} is that you can embed a molecule using a `URL`.
This makes things much easier to visualize molecules in a website.
You only need to upload the molecule file and provide the `URL` for that file.
Here is the javascript library and the `HTML div` element you would need for this:

```
<script src="https://3Dmol.csb.pitt.edu/build/3Dmol-min.js"></script>

<div style="height: 300px; width: 500px;"
  class='viewer_3Dmoljs' data-datatype='xyz'
  data-backgroundcolor='0xffffff'
  data-href='/path/to/myMolecule.xyz'
  data-style='stick'>
</div>
```
### Decacylene

As an example you can see a [decacylene](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/Decacyclene){:target="_blank"}
molecule visualization (embedded in markdown) using an `xyz` file and `3DMol.js` library.

<div style="height: 300px; width: 500px;"
  class='viewer_3Dmoljs' data-datatype='xyz' data-backgroundcolor='0xffffff'
  data-href='/assets/molecules/dc.xyz'
  data-style='stick'>
</div>

Visualizing from a database
---------------------------
Alternatively with `3DMol.js`, you can visualize molecules from databases such as RSCB or PubChem.

### 1YCR
Here is an example for visualizing a protein ([1YCR](http://www.rcsb.org/structure/1YCR){:target="_blank"})
from the [Protein Data Bank](http://www.rcsb.org/){:target="_blank"}.

<div style="height: 300px; width: 500px; position: relative;" class='viewer_3Dmoljs' data-pdb='1YCR' data-backgroundcolor='0xffffff'
     data-select1='chain:A' data-style1='cartoon:color=spectrum' data-surface1='opacity:.7;color:white' data-select2='chain:B' data-style2='stick'>
</div>

Jupyter notebook
----------------
You can also embed an interactive 3Dmol.js viewer in a Jupyter notebook using `py3Dmol`, a simple `IPython/Jupyter` widget.
> [Click here for more information.](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/3dmol/3Dmol.js/blob/9050b97144e81f065df7eecc87ba9a16723ab14b/py3Dmol/examples.ipynb)

MolView
========
[MolView](http://molview.org/){:target="_blank"} is a great little website which gets pretty close to
a stand-alone molecular visualizer. You can search multiple databases, draw molecules, guess 3D stuctures,
and even perform energy minimization. Also, you can embed molecules in a web page using a `HTML iframe` element.

Just search your molecule, then click *Tools -> Embed*. Copy the *HTML Code* and paste it in a html file.
Here is the `iframe` element for *decacylene*:

```
<iframe style="width: 500px; height: 300px;" frameborder="0"
  src="https://embed.molview.org/v1/?mode=balls&cid=67448&bg=white">
</iframe>
```
### Decacylene

<iframe style="width: 500px; height: 300px;" frameborder="0"
  src="https://embed.molview.org/v1/?mode=balls&cid=67448&bg=white">
</iframe>

Drawing and embedding a molecule
--------------------------------

Using MolView's user interface, you can draw a molecule with the tools on the left hand side in the 2D view.
After you finish drawing, click the **2D to 3D** button on top of the molecule to render the 3D image.
This will also create a molecule id, which you can see in the address bar of your browser.
Using that id you can either use the same `iframe` element and change the id, or go to *Tools -> Embed*
to generate a new html element.

For example, *caffeine*'s id is `2519`. By using the same `iframe` element as *decacylene* and changing the
`cid=67448` to `cid=2519` you can generate a new embed:
```
<iframe style="width: 500px; height: 300px;" frameborder="0"
  src="https://embed.molview.org/v1/?mode=balls&cid=2519&bg=white">
</iframe>
```
which looks like:

<iframe style="width: 500px; height: 300px;" frameborder="0"
  src="https://embed.molview.org/v1/?mode=balls&cid=2519&bg=white">
</iframe>

Visualizing from a database
---------------------------

MolView makes it really easy to visualize entries from databases.
You can search through the databases or use specific *id* numbers to visualize entries.
Here are the main databases supported by MolView:
-   PubChem Compounds (~51 million compounds)
-   RSCB Protein Data Bank (~100.000 macromolecules)
-   Crystallography Open Database (~300.000 crystals)
-   NIST Chemistry WebBook (~30.000 spectra)

### Diamond from the Crystallography Open Database

<iframe style="width: 500px; height: 300px;" frameborder="0"
  src="https://embed.molview.org/v1/?mode=balls&codid=9012304&bg=white">
</iframe>

By using the *id* of diamond from Crystallography Open Database (COD) and using the following `HTML iframe`
element, crystal structures can also be visualized. Note that here the link has `codid=9012304`
because we are using the Crystallography Open Database.

```
<iframe style="width: 500px; height: 300px;" frameborder="0"
  src="https://embed.molview.org/v1/?mode=balls&codid=9012304&bg=white">
</iframe>
```

NGLview
=======

[NGLview](http://nglviewer.org/ngl/){:target="_blank"} is a great visualizer with many options and has a [very active development team on GitHub](https://github.com/arose/nglview){:target="_blank"}.
It has a great Python library which allows you to visualize molecules and trajectories
in Jupyter notebooks!

Jupyter notebook
----------------
NGLview allows beautiful visualization of molecules embedded in Jupyter notebook:

<p> <a href="https://github.com/arose/nglview" target="_blank">
<img border="0" alt="nglview-github" src="https://github.com/arose/nglview/blob/master/examples/images/membrane.gif?raw=true">
</a></p>

Using the Python library, you can create `html` files for molecules/trajectories which you can visualize using a browser:

<p> <a href="https://github.com/arose/nglview/blob/master/docs/embed.md" target="_blank">
<img border="0" alt="nglview-embed" src="https://github.com/arose/nglview/blob/master/docs/images/embed.gif?raw=true">
</a></p>

Online visualizer
-----------------

Also, it has an online visualizer which allows you to upload molecules from your computer.
Here, give it a try:

<p> <a href="http://nglviewer.org/ngl/" target="_blank">
<img border="0" alt="nglviewer-screenshot" src="/assets/img/nglviewer-screenshot.png">
</a></p>

Three.js
========

[Three.js](https://threejs.org/){:target="_blank"} is a cross-browser JavaScript library/API used to create and display
animated 3D computer graphics in a web browser.
It's fairly powerful and you can create neat animations using a little javascript.
Definitely checkout the [featured projects](https://threejs.org/){:target="_blank"}.
Three.js has a built-in [PDBLoader](https://threejs.org/docs/#examples/loaders/PDBLoader){:target="_blank"}
which you can use to load molecules.

Alternatively, you can use the [atomVis](https://github.com/kbsezginel/visualization/tree/master/three-js/atomVis){:target="_blank"}
template I created. The template allows you to visualize a molecule locally, without running a web server.
However, this means that you need to convert your molecule file into a javascript file
in order to visualize it as browsers don't allow reading of regular local files for security reasons.
Take a look at the code and let me know if you have any questions/suggestions.

If you know other web-based methods for visualizing molecules please feel free to contribute/comment!
